# Employee-Attrition
Employee attrition refers to the natural process of employees leaving an organization for various reasons, such as resignations, retirements, terminations, or any other form of departure. It is often measured as a percentage or rate reflecting the number of employees who have left the organization over a specified period, typically annually, relative to the total workforce.
